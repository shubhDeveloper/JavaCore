>>> Exception = An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event which occur during the excution
-- Of program i.e runtime that disturb the normal flow of program

>>> Throwable class is the parent class of exception

>>> Diffrence between Exception and errors

>>> Exception >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1) In most of the cases exception occured by our program
2) Exceptions are recoverable
3) Exceptions are mainly 2 types 1)checked exception 2) unchecked Exception


>> Errors >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1) Most of the cases errors occurs because of lack of our system resorces not out program
2) Errors are not recoverable
3) Errors only one type 1) unchecked errors

>> Checked and unchecked exception >>>>>>>>>>>>>

-- Checked Exception =: checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked and handeled at runtime
-- Unchecked Exception =: Unchecked exceptions are the exceptions that are not checked and handeled at compile time

>> We can handel exception using 5 keywords >>>>>>>>>>

 1) try 2) catch 3) finally 4) throw 5) throws

 1)------------:: try and catch syntax ::---------------
 
 try
 {
     // Risky code
 }
 catch(Exception class name or reference var name)
 {
    //handling code 
 }
 
 
 ** We have three ways to print exception
 1) e.printStackTrace = This method print all about exception
 2) e.toString() = print
 3) e.getMessage() = print onlu exception discreption
 
 
 *****************Diffrence between throw and throws********************
 
 1) throws keyword is used to declare the exception i.e. it indicates the caller method that given exception can occur so 
 we have to handel it eather using try catch block or again declare it by using throws keyword
 
 2) throw keyword is mainly used for runtime exceptions or unchecked exceptions but throws keyword mainly used for compile
 time exceptions or checked exceptions
 
 3) In case of throw keyword we can throw only single exception but in case of throws keyword we can declared multiople 
 exceptions ex. void readFile() throws FileNotFoundException, NullPointerException
 
 4) Throw keyword is used with the method but throws keyword is used with method signature 
 
 5) Throw keyword is followed by new instance i.e object but throws keyword is followed by class not with the instance
 
 6) we can not write any statement after throw keyword thus it can be used to break the statement but there is no rule for 
 throws keyword
